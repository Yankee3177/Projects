## Runnable projects

1. Area.py:
   - This program "randomly" chooses 2 shapes out of 3 and plots points inside of those shapes. It calculates the ratio of the points that touches the inside shape. It shows that by dividing the area of the outside shape by the inside shape you can predict the ratio. To prove that, the program keeps track of the points that touch the inside shape and divides it by the amount of points plotted. The more points you plot the closer you get to the predicted ratio.
