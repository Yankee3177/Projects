## Runnable projects

1. Area.py:
   - This program "randomly" chooses 2 shapes out of 3 and plots points inside of those shapes. It calculates the ratio of the points that touch the inside shape. It shows that by dividing the area of the outside shape by the inside shape you can predict the ratio. To prove that, the program keeps track of the points that touch the inside shape and divides it by the amount of points plotted. The more points you plot the closer you get to the predicted ratio.
2. Caesar Encryption.py:
   - This program is my interpretation of Caesar's encryption algorithm.
3. SphereProject.py:
   - This program puts a sphere on a 3d grid and plots points inside of the sphere. You determine the amount of points you want to plot and the size of the sphere.
4. Stitching Design.py:
   - This program "stitches" a design based on the phrase that's being passed in. It uses Euler's number and specific rules to determine what the final stitch pattern looks like.

## Need SQL files to run

1. Final Part 2.py:
   - Use nutritionapp.sql dump to create the sql database that the app uses.
   - This app stores and shows recipes.
   - You can create multiple user accounts to store recipes.
2. databaseFinal.py:
   - Use abclass.sql dump to create the sql database that the app uses.
   - This app was a simulation of a database used in a school environment.
   - It has students, their hobbies, their school, and their sports.
   - This app is the gui to perform CRUD commands on the database.
